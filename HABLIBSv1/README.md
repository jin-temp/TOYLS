Thanks for checking out HABLIBS, an email template application built with Processing 3.0 that puts a new spin on the same old emails. 

For more information about HAB LIBS, visit http://jintemp.com/creations/digital-toyl-box/hab-libs/. Use the contact form to get in touch with Jinnie if you have any questions.

To run HABLIBS:

1. Make sure you have downloaded and installed Processing 3.0, an open source programming language and integrated development enviroment available for free download at https://processing.org/download/
2. Create a free account with Temboo at https://temboo.com 
3. Follow the instructions at https://temboo.com/library/Library/Google/OAuth/ to obtain Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh token
4. Download the HABLIBS repository and unzip it. Open the HABLIBSv1.pde file in Processing.
5. In the "HABLIBSv1" tab, be sure to replace the temboo session placeholders (ACCOUNT, APPLICATION, KEY) with your own Temboo account information (after logging in to Temboo, click Account > Applications)
6. In the "email" tab, replace the placeholder OAUTH credentials (CLIENTSECRET, REFRESHTOKEN, CLIENTID) with the credentials you got in step 3.
7. Make sure you have installed both the G4P and Temboo libraries for Processing (after opening Processing, click Sketch > Import Library > Add Library... and then search for "G4P" and "Temboo", click "Install" button)
8. Run the sketch!
